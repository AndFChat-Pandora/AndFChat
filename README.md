## FAQ
***Switching from wlan(WiFi) -> mobile internet or mobile internet -> wlan is disconnecting me, help?!***

Sorry, you are switching IP addresses. I see no easy way to fix this, despite reconnecting with the other IP, but automatic reconnecting is not implemented right now. 

***Why can I only connect with one character at the same time? Will there be any update to fix this?***

There is barely enough space on a phone for one character. We currently don't see any reason to complicate this by adding multiple connections at the same time. 

***How do I post Ads?***

There are two ways to post an ad: 
1. Start your post with /ad [text] that will automatically post as ad. 
2. Write your post and don't send it, select Post ad in the action Menu.
