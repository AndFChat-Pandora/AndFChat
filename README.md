#AndFChat (3rd part Flist-Client)
Developed for minimum API Level: 14, Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher
Really not the best piece of code. My first time creating a bigger project with Android.

Tested on:
- Nexus 10 (v. 4.4.2)
- HUAWAI whatever (v. 4.0.4)

Any help, tips and thanks are welcomed! :)

## FAQ

***Switching from wlan-> mobile internet or mobile internet -> wlan is disconnecting me, help?!***

Sorry, you are swichting ip adresses. I see no easy way to fix this, despite reconnecting with the other IP, but automatic reconnecting is not implemented right now.

***Why can I only connect with one character at the same time? Will there be any update to fix this?***

Nope, seriously there is not enough space on a phone for one character. Don't see any reason to add multiple connections at the same time.
