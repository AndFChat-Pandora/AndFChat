## FAQ
***Switching between Wifi networks or between WiFi and mobile internet is disconnecting me, help?!***

Sorry, you are switching IP addresses. There is no easy way to fix this, other than reconnecting with the other IP, but automatic reconnecting is not implemented right now. 

***Why can I only connect with one character at a time? Will there be any update to fix this?***

There is barely enough space on a phone for one character.
We currently don't see any reason to complicate this by adding multiple connections at the same time. 

***How do I post an ad?***

There are two ways to post an ad: 

1. Starting your post with /ad [text] will automatically post the text as an ad.

2. Write your post and don't send it, select Post Ad in the Actions menu.
 
***How do I ignore or unignore a user?***

Just type /ignore [name] to ignore, or /unignore [name] to unignore.
