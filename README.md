## FAQ

***Switching from wlan-> mobile internet or mobile internet -> wlan is disconnecting me, help?!***

Sorry, you are swichting ip adresses. I see no easy way to fix this, despite reconnecting with the other IP, but automatic reconnecting is not implemented right now.

***Why can I only connect with one character at the same time? Will there be any update to fix this?***

Nope, seriously there is not enough space on a phone for one character. Don't see any reason to add multiple connections at the same time.
